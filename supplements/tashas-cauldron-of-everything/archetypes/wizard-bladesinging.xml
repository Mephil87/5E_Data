			<p>Bladesingers master a tradition of wizardry that incorporates swordplay and dance. Originally created by elves, this tradition has been adopted by non-elf practitioners, who honor and expand on the elven ways.</p>
			<p class="indent">In combat, a bladesinger uses a series of intricate, elegant maneuvers that fend off harm and allow the bladesinger to channel magic into devastating attacks and a cunning defense. Many who have observed a bladesinger at work remember the display as one of the more beautiful experiences in their life, a glorious dance accompanied by a singing blade.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You gain a bonus to your AC equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1).</li>
				<li>Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.</li>
				<li>You have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatics) checks.</li>
