			<p>A monk who follows the Way of the Astral Self believes their body is an illusion. They see their ki as a representation of their true form, an astral self. This astral self has the capacity to be a force of order or disorder, with some monasteries training students to use their power to protect the weak and other instructing aspirants in how to manifest their true selves in service to the mighty.</p>

			<ul>
				<li>You can use your Wisdom modifier in place of your Strength modifier when making Strength checks and Strength saving throws.</li>
